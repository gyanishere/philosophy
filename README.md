# Philosophy

## What is this?
This is a playlist of philosophical concepts, largely related to language and cognition (for now), that I'm attempting to transpose onto code. I feel that code works particularly well for this type of analytic philosophy. I'm going to try to use a mix of programming languages, including JS, Python (maybe Scheme?) so that I improve my understanding of CS in addition to philospohy. The individual files serve more as informational documents (to elucidate specific concepts) rather than applications, so don't bother running anything unless a process is explicitly detailed in the file's comments.

## Who is this for?
Anyone with an itnerest in programming, CS, logic, philosophy, epistemology, ontologies, etc., etc. I'm a student so no guarantee that everything is correct ;) Leave me an issue or message me on my [website](https://gyan.biz) if you have any ideas/suggestions/issues.
