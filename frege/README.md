# About Frege
Gottlob Frege [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege) was a German philosopher, logician, and mathematician. Frege understood that the accepted schema of Aristotle's subject-predicate failed to expose the deceptive nature of natural language. In the Begriffsschrift, Frege offers a seminal treatise of modern logic. The highlights of this text include his writings on a function-argument schema, quantification theory, sentence connectives, and truth-conditional function theory. Frege builds on this logical framework with Sense and Reference, which attempts to remedy some problems of identity with regard to sentential logic.
